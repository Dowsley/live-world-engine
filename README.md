# Live World Engine

Self-contained voxel engine with heavy emphasis on ecosystems and simulations.

Alive, breathing, and heavily inspired in Dwarf-Fortress. I'm building this as a tool for personal worldbuilding.

## Engine

Place the engine source code (regardless of platform) inside `src/engine`.
